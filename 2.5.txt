1.a cluster and a hadoop cluster
CLUSTER
A cluster is like a datacenter.
it is the single point of storage.
Mostly, each cluster stores specific data.
There is no replication of data in a singke cluster.
so,it is a single point of failure.
if data in the cluster is lost there is no backup for that data.
HADOOP CLUSTER
In a hadoop cluster, unstructured data can be stored.
multiple copies of data are stored in various clusters.
so even if a cluster fails,we have backup for that data.
the hadoop clusters are distributed across various systems and information can be accessed from any of them.
large amount of data can be stored and the processing is very fast compared to cluster.

2.COMPONENTS OF HADOOP 1.X
COMPONENTS OF HADOOP 1.X
 The components are
 1.namenode
2.datanode
3.job tracker
4.task tracker

NAME NODE
It consists of the metadata of files and the hadoop filesystem tree.
It contains of details of which block is stored in which data node.
There can be only one name node.
It acts like the master node.
It does not store any data.
If the name node fails the entire cluster fails.
SECONDARY NAMENODE
It performs checkpoints on the metadata in namenode. 
It does not act as a name node even if name node fails.
It just helps the name nodes. 
DATANODE
It stores the actual data of the hadoop filesystem.
It notifies the name of the data it holds
It signals name nodes when it starts processing its data.
The signals are sent often to indicate it is active.
Those signals are known as heartbeat.
It acts like the slave.
It performs the works assigned to it from the name node.
JOBTRACKER
It controls the execution of map reduce jobs.
TASKTRACKER
It runs individual map-reduce jobs on datanodes.
Periodically communicates with the jobtracker to give updates and receive instructions.
